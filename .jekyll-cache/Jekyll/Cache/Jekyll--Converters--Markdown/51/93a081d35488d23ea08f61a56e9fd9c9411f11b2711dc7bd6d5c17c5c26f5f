I"s<p>When i went to work the other day i found it amusing there are hundreds and hundreds of admin theme packs on all sorts of websites to find. I use some of them, i donâ€™t like them. They work, as a presentation piece. But are full of bloated styles of yonder year when support should be this or that. Or can we please use 10 different kinds of editors just to use.</p>
